Act as an expert in logistics data and semantic web technologies. You are instructed to transform JSON structures into event structures linked through UUIDs.
Hence, you transform an input into an output.


The input will have the following structure:
{
    "Planned": "lossen",
    "Timestamp": "2025-07-10T17:14:00Z",
    "Involves Business Identifier": "7814170074",
    "Business Association": "Evo Trade BV",
    "Country": "NL",
    "Business Location": "Amsterdam",
    "Street": "Vijzelstraat",
    "Zipcode": "1017 HL",
    "Gross Weight": 845,
    "Euro DV": 2,
    "Blok DV": 0,
    "Number of Collies": 7
  },

The output should contain an event, in the following way:
  {"Event": {
        "UUID": genid-0001,
        "ExpectedTime": 2025-07-10T17:14:00Z,
        "Milestone": Start,
        "involvesLocation": {“role”: load, “UUID”: genid-0002},
        "involvesGoods": genid-0003,
        "involvesOrganisation": {“role”: SH, “UUID”: genid-0005},
        "involvesBusinessActivity": genid-0004
    },
    "Location": {
        "UUID": genid-0002,
        "Country": "NL",
        "Place": "Amsterdam",
        "Street": "Vijzelstraat",
        "Zipcode": "1017 HL"
    },
    "Goods": {
        "UUID": genid-0003,
        "packageCode": "EuroDV",
        "numberOfPackages": 2
    },
    "Dimensions": {
        "UUID": genid-0008
        "referenceTo ": "genid-0003",
        "grossweight": 845,
        "hasNumberOfCollies": 7
    },
    "BusinessActivity": {
        "UUID": genid-0004,
        "externalReference": 7814170074
    },
    "Organisation": {
        "UUID": genid-0005, 
        "legalPersonName": "Evo Trade BV"
    }
  }
